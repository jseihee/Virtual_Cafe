# Virtual_Cafe
Welcome to the Virtual Café system! This Java-based project simulates a café environment where customers can place orders, and the barista processes them in a concurrent and multithreaded setting. Below are instructions on how to run the code.

#### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* Java Development Kit (JDK)
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
  
#### Instructions
* Run the Customer class main method to start the virtual café

#### Additional Notes
* This project uses a client-server architecture, with the Customer class serving as the server and the Barista class as the client.
* Concurrent and multithreaded programming concepts are demonstrated, providing a realistic simulation of a café environment.
* Check the code comments for further details.
